### Face Mask Detector: Ensuring Safety with Machine Learning

Introducing the **Face Mask Detector**, an innovative application designed to identify and verify if people are wearing face masks using **machine learning**. Built with **Python**, **Computer Vision (cv2)**, and **XML documents** for recognition and model training, this tool offers a practical solution for safety and compliance.

**Key Features:**

- **Python & Computer Vision (cv2)**: Leverages Python and OpenCV for advanced image processing and real-time detection.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes XML documents to train models for accurate face mask recognition and classification.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Provides immediate feedback on face mask usage, supporting safety protocols and health measures.

The **Face Mask Detector** is a prime example of how machine learning can be applied to enhance public safety and compliance. Ideal for those interested in AI, image recognition, or creating tools that address real-world challenges.
